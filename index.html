            <p>We all know how genetic sequencing is very expensive, this has made it difficult for the society to get access to resources</p>

        <h2>Sickle cell anemia</h2>
        <P>Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout your body.</P>
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Anameia</li>
          <li>Periodic pain</li>
          <li>Painful swelling of hands and feet</li>
          <li>Frequent infections.</li>
          <li>Delayed growth</li>
          <li>Vision problems</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Chronic conditions</h3>
        <p>Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints.</p>
        <p>Swelling in the hands or feet.</p>
        <p>Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch.</p> 
        <p>Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection.</p>
         <p>Pale skin or nail beds.</p>
         <p>Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes</p>
         <p>Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyesy.</p> 
         <h3>Complications</h3>
         <p>Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal.</li>
          <li>Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments.</li>
          <li>Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal.</li>
          <li>Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness.</li>
          <li>Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal.</li>
          <li>Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs.</li>
          <li>Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones</li>
          
        </ol>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
         <p>If you carry the sickle cell trait, seeing a genetic counselor before trying to conceive can help you understand your risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia. He or she can also explain possible treatments, preventive measures and reproductive options.</p>
